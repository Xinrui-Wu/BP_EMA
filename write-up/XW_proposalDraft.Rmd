# Data description

Here we describe two data streams used in our exploratory data analysis that were collected as part of an observational in-patient study of individuals at elevated risk of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors (STBs).  Each recruited patient was provided with a wearable, wrist-worn device (Empatica E4) and asked to press a button on the device at self-identified moments of suicidal distress.  During the study, each recruited patient also received survey prompts for measuring suicidal ideation at several random times a day.  

The first data stream (i.e., the "BP dataset") contains a unique identification number, a timestamp of the button press, and time since recruitment (runtime) for the button press.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The second data stream (i.e., the "EMA dataset") contains a unique identifier, a timestamp of the survey prompt, time since recruitment for the button press, and the sum score built from the suvrey prompt responses to suicidal ideation questions (desire, intent, and resist urge).  the answers and the messages of the surveys taken by observations.

# Problem and Data cleaning process

## Main purpose

The motivating question behind this exploratory data analysis is to assess whether survey prompts that ask about current level of suicidal ideation may act as a potential reminder and therefore increase button presses in the near future.  To answer this question, in this report we test whether individuals number of button presses increased after a survey prompt when compared to before one.

Mathematically, let $t$ denote time in study where $t=0$ is time of recruitment.  In an ideal world, the researcher would be able to passively measure the suicidal ideation (SI) score ($X_t$) at every time $t>0$ without interacting with the patient.  Suicide researchers are interested in understanding whether heightened levels of suicidal ideation leads to increased moments of suicidal distress.  One way to quantify this concept, is to look at the number of button presses in a future time window.  That is, let $Y_{t, \Delta}$ denote the number of button presses in a time window $\Delta$ after time $t$.  For example, $Y_{t,3}$ is the number of button presses in the 3-hours following time $t$. Then the quantity of interest is the average number of button presses in the next $\Delta$ time units given the individual is has SI score equal to $x$ at time $t$, i.e., $E \left[ Y_{t,\Delta} \mid X_t = x \right]$.  

The key issue is that the SI score is not passively available at every $t$; instead, researchers must deliver survey prompts to the individual to measure their SI score.  However, survey prompts may act as a reminder.  For example, an individual with a high SI score at the time of prompt delivery may then reflect on their response to the survey and thus increase their button presses in the near future.  In this case, if an individual received a prompt at time $t$, then $Y_{t,\Delta}$ will be inflated by delivery of the survey prompt.  

We propose to leverage ideas from regression discontinuity design to propose the use of the $\Delta$ time units prior to time $t$ as a proxy for the number of button presses in the $\Delta$ time units after time $t$ that do not include the prompt delivery effect.  Mathematically, define $Y_{t,-\Delta}$ to denote the number of button presses in a time window $\Delta$ prior to time $t$. In this way, by modeling the difference between the number of presses before and after delivery of a survey prompt, we hope to model the causal effect of the treatment (i.e., survey prompt delivery) and thus estimate the quantity of interest.  In this report, we avoided formally defining the effect of interest using causal inference notation; however, future methodological work will include formal causal definitions, discussions of identifiability, and proposed estimation procedures based on regression discontinuity design techniques.


## Data cleaning

To answer this problem, we have cleaned the data streams and constructed a new dataset “bp_ema” in the following steps. Note, the data cleaning process can be replicated by using the functions in the [data cleaning files](https://github.com/Xinrui-Wu/BP_EMA/blob/master/methods/dataManipulation.R) in our github repository.

First, we ask the user to specify a list of $m$ time windows (e.g., 1,3,5 hours). For each time window $\Delta$ in this list, we take the following steps:

1. For each survey prompt, i.e., for each row in the EMA dataset, we count the number of button presses that are measured both $\Delta$ hours _before_ and _after_ the survey prompt delivery time respectively.
2. Survey prompts are delivered throughout the day.  The closest 2 delivery times for an individual were within 1 hour.  Therefore, as long as we set the length of the time interval $\Delta>1$, there is a non-negligible chance that there could be button presses falling in these time windows for more than 1 survey prompt. For those presses, we count the button press in the time interval of its closest survey.
  * For instance, if $\Delta = 2$ and a button press by survey prompt X was 1 hour before a survey A that X took, 1.5 hours after another survey B that X took, we count the press as it was in the time interval before survey A.
3.  We deleted 3 rows of the EMA dataset where SI score is missing.

Applying this procedure, there are 963 entries and (4+2m) variables in the bp_ema dataset :

## Exploratory data analysis

### Count of presses

Although we choose a relatively large time window in order to get enough presses around each survey, there are still more than 800 entries without any presses before or after that survey, which could conceal the differences in other entries. So we first ignore those entries and consider the remaining 137 entries.


For time windows k = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, comparing pre-presses and post-presses, as is shown in Figure 1, we find that the median of post-presses is larger than that of pre-presses for k = 3, 5. Thus it seems that there tend to be more post-presses than pre-presses.

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:1}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{./figure/boxplot_for_windows.png}
\caption{Pre-presses and Post-presses for different time windows}
\end{figure}


### SI score and the difference of presses

Then we expect that the suicidal score (SI score) would affect the difference of post-presses and pre-presses. 

The SI scores are integers in [0, 27], where higher SI scores reflect higher suicidal tendency.

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:2}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in, height=4in]{./figure/hist.png}
\caption{Distribution of the SI score}
\end{figure}

As is shown in Figure 2,  the scores are naturally separated by 4 and 17. So we separate the data to 3 subsets where their SI scores lie in  [0, 3], [4, 16], [17, 27] respectively and compare pre-presses and post-presse for each subset with k = 3. The result is shown in Figure 3 and Table 4.


\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:3}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7in, height=4in]{./figure/box_si_3.png}
\caption{Post-presses and Pre-presses in subsets by SI score}
\end{figure}


\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
SI score     & Entries & Mean pre-presses & Mean post-presses & p value (paired) & p value (2 sample) \\ \hline \hline
{[}0, 3{]}   & 21      & 0.62             & 0.52              & 0.70             & 0.61               \\ \hline
{[}4, 16{]}  & 86      & 0.88             & 1.08              & 0.47             & 0.43               \\ \hline
{[}17, 27{]} & 30      & 0.83             & 1.47              & 0.15             & 0.10                \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Compare presses in subsets by SI score}
\label{table4}
\end{table}

We can see that pre-presses and post-presses are similar in the first subset since here observations have smaller SI scores and hardly press the button. As the SI score grows, the difference becomes more significant and when SI score exceeds 17, the difference is more significant than that in the whole dataset.

## Model fitting
This section is accomplished with time window k = 3. Situations with other time windows are shown in the next section.

Fit the following 3 kinds of Poisson regression models :

(1) M1 (without SI covariate): $log(\lambda) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} 1_{\{k=1\}}$ , \newline
(2) M2 (linear SI covariate): $log(\lambda) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\times 1_{\{K=1\}} + \beta_{2} \times SI +  \beta_{3} \times SI \times 1_{\{k=1\}}$, \newline
(3) M3 (B-splined SI covariate): $log(\lambda) \sim 1_{\{K=1\}} + bs(SI) + 1_{\{K=1\}}:bs(SI)$, \newline

where ":" means an interaction term, $\lambda$ is the expectation of the times of presses and $1_{\{K=1\}}$ is an indicate term of whether is is a post-survey count. 

Then test whether parameters corresponding to $1_{\{K=1\}}$ are significantly non-zero.

In Model 1, we refuse $\beta_1 = 0$ thus there is significant difference between pre-presses and post-presses if an observation has non-zero button presses around a survey.

In Model 2 and Model 3, some parameters corresponding to the interaction of SI and $1_{\{k=1\}}$ are significantly non-zero. The curves of the presses with respect to the SI score is shown in Figure 4. \newline

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:4}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8in, height=4in]{./figure/model_curve.png}
\caption{Model curve for k=3}
\end{figure}

We can see from the figure that there is significant difference between pre-presses and post-presses when SI score exceeds 13.

# Sensitivity analyses

Fit the 3 models in Section 3 with k = 0.5, 1, 2, 5.

## $k<3$
For situations where $k<3$, we cannot refuse the null hypothesis in the tests with form "$H_0: \beta = 0 \quad v.s. \quad H_1: \beta \neq 0$", where $\beta$ is any parameter corresponding to $1_{\{k=1\}}$. And the curves of the presses with respect to the SI score in Figure 5 also shows that we cannot distinguish pre-presses and post-presses significantly. This may becasue in such short time window, there are hardly any presses in each entry and thus there aren't enough samples for a model. \newline

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:5}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8in, height=4in]{./figure/model_curve_1.png}
\caption{Model curve for k=1}
\end{figure}

## $k>3$
For $k=5$, some parameters corresponding to the interaction of SI and $1_{\{k=1\}}$ are significantly non-zero. The curves of the presses with respect to the SI score is shown in Figure 6. \newline

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:6}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8in, height=4in]{./figure/model_curve_5.png}
\caption{Model curve for k=5}
\end{figure}


The result is similar with that for k = 3 only the lower limit of SI score above which there is significant difference between pre-presses and post-presses is smaller.\newline
