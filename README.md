# Models for testing button presses before and after EMA surveys


In an experiment related to suicidal tendency, 2 kinds of data were collected. 

On one hand, observations were asked to press the button on a special device whenever they felt pressure through out a day, and the Button Press data (the BP data) records the time of those presses.

On the other hand,  each observation received surveys for testing their suicidal tendency several times a day and might choose to finish some of them, the answer of which was in the EMA data.

Since for the observations, the surveys could remind them of the experiment, it is reasonable to assume that observations tended to press the button more frequently after taking a survey.

Thus, in this project, we are aiming to investigate the difference between the number of presses before a survey and after that survey, as well as how the difference was influenced by covariates including the suicidal score.
